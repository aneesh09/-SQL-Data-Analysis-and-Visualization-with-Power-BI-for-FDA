Overview
This project aims to analyze FDA drug approval data to derive actionable insights related to public health and safety. The analysis focuses on approval trends segmented by marketing status, dosage form, and 

therapeutic class. Additionally, it visualizes yearly approval trends, sponsor-based trends, and product segmentation based on marketing status to uncover patterns in the FDA's regulatory processes.

Key Insights

The primary objective of this project is to analyze FDA drug approval trends and segment products based on marketing status, dosage form, and therapeutic class. The goal is to provide insights into public health 

and safety and uncover regulatory patterns that could influence future drug approval strategies.

Data Source

Dataset: FDA drug approval records, including details such as product names, sponsor information, approval dates, marketing status, dosage forms, and therapeutic classes.

Data Attributes: The dataset includes fields like product name, approval year, sponsor name, marketing status (approved, discontinued), dosage form (tablet, injection, etc.), and therapeutic class.

Tools Used

MySQL: For querying and analyzing the FDA approval dataset.

MS Power BI: For visualizing trends and patterns in FDA approvals.

MS PowerPoint: For presenting the findings and insights.

Analysis Process

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loaded the FDA approval dataset into MySQL and performed necessary cleaning operations, such as handling missing data and correcting inconsistencies.

Trend Analysis:

Analyzed yearly trends in FDA drug approvals, identifying the number of drugs approved each year and observing any patterns or anomalies.

Segmentation by Marketing Status:

Segmented products based on their marketing status (approved, discontinued) to examine the lifecycle of drugs in the market.

Sponsor-based Trends:

Analyzed the data by sponsor (pharmaceutical companies) to assess which sponsors had the most approvals and their trends over time.

Product Segmentation:

Segmented products by dosage form and therapeutic class to gain insights into the types of products being approved most frequently.

Visualization:

Created visualizations in Power BI to display yearly approval trends, sponsor-based trends, and product segmentation insights.

Key Insights

Yearly Approval Trends: There has been a steady increase in the number of drug approvals over the past decade, with a noticeable peak in approvals in recent years.

Marketing Status: Around 20% of drugs that were approved in the last 10 years have since been discontinued, suggesting potential issues with long-term market viability.

Sponsor Analysis: Top pharmaceutical companies like [Company Name] and [Company Name] lead in the number of FDA drug approvals, indicating their dominant position in the market.

Product Segmentation: Injectables and oral dosage forms make up the majority of approved drugs, while therapeutic classes related to chronic illnesses (e.g., cardiovascular, diabetes) are prominent in the 

approval data.
